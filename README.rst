RidePooling
===========

Simulation Tool to distribute ride requests among vehicles. Ride requests can either be created from synthetic demand profiles, or can be imported as .csv. 
The requests will be distributed to the vehicles according to the selected parameters:

* delay_factor: creating the least possible delay for passangers
* pooling_factor: create the highest possible pooling quote
* balance_factor: distributing the requests evenly among the vehicles
* distance_factor: giving the requests to the vehicle closest to the passanger

The simulation creates all the possible schedules for the vehicles and selects the most fitting for the selected parameters.
A request is rejected if the maximum delay is exceeded.

outputs:

* schedule: table of all trips for all vehicles
* requests_denied: list of denied requests
* requests: copy of all processed requests
* summary: summary of simulation and per vehicle with relevant statistical data
* summary per vehicle: table of trips per vehicle. 

Get started
-----------

You can clone the current repository of RidePooling to your local machine using HTTPS:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/marcusschober/ridepooling.git

Or SSH:

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:marcusschober/ridepooling.git

Setting up an environment
-------------------------

With Virtual Env
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Create a new virtual environment (for example in PyCharm or via the command line ``python3 -m venv venv``). Activate it with:
| Terminal:  ``source venv/bin/activate``
| Windows: ``venv\Scripts\activate``
| Note: You need to be in the project folder to activate the environment
|
| Install the requirements with ``pip install .``

| Note: PyCharm might tell you that it can't find the main module.
| In that case you have to right click the folder "src" and select
| "Mark Directory as" -> "Sources Root"

With Poetry
~~~~~~~~~~~

| First install Poetry

.. code:: bash

    pip install poetry

| Then initialize the virtual environment for Poetry. It will be stored it in the
cache directory, and display a randomly generated name for the virtual environment.

.. code:: bash

    poetry env use python

or on Windows

.. code:: bash

    poetry env use py

| Poetry also installs any dependencies listed in the projectâ€™s pyproject.toml file.


Running the program
-------------------

To run this from the command line, go to the root folder of this repository,
then type ``python -m ridepooling`` into the terminal. A config path can be given as
an additional argument.

In PyCharm, this can be set up as a run configuration:

* create a new python configuration
* choose module name instead of script path
* input the module name ``ridepooling``
* set the root directory of this repository as the working directory

Example
-------

to run example use:

.. code:: bash

    python -m ridepooling



Features
--------

* parameters for pooling decision: delay, pooling-rate, balance, distance
* creating ride requests from synthetic demand profile
* outputs: schedule for vehicles, summary
